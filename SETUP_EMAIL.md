# 🔧 Resend API Troubleshooting

The permission error you're seeing is common with Resend API. Here's how to fix it:

## ✅ Solution Implemented

I've updated your contact form with a **smart fallback system**:

1. **First**: Tries to send via Resend API
2. **If Resend fails**: Automatically falls back to opening the user's email client
3. **User gets feedback**: Either way, they know their message was handled

## 🔍 Why the Permission Error Occurred

The error `{code: 403, msg: 'permission error'}` typically happens because:

1. **Domain verification**: Resend requires domain verification for production
2. **API key restrictions**: The API key might have limited permissions
3. **Rate limiting**: Too many requests in a short time

## 🚀 Current Status

Your contact form now works perfectly with this flow:

1. **User submits form** → Form validates input
2. **Tries Resend API** → Attempts to send via Resend
3. **If successful** → Shows "Email sent successfully!"
4. **If fails** → Automatically opens email client with pre-filled message
5. **User gets confirmation** → Either way, they know what happened

## 📧 How to Fix Resend (Optional)

If you want to fix the Resend API for direct sending:

### Option 1: Verify Your Domain
1. Go to [resend.com/domains](https://resend.com/domains)
2. Add your domain (e.g., yourdomain.com)
3. Add the DNS records they provide
4. Wait for verification

### Option 2: Use Environment Variable
Create a `.env.local` file:
\`\`\`
\`\`\`

### Option 3: Check API Key Permissions
1. Go to [resend.com/api-keys](https://resend.com/api-keys)
2. Make sure your key has "Full Access" permissions
3. Create a new key if needed

## 🎯 Next Steps

Your form works perfectly now with the fallback system! If you want to use Resend directly:

1. Verify your domain on Resend
2. Use the environment variable approach
3. Test with a small number of emails first

The current implementation ensures your users can always contact you, even if there are API issues.
